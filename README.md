# Unexpected Pseudo-element Style Inheritance in Media Queries

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to pseudo-element styling within media queries.  The bug arises from the unexpected inheritance of parent element styles by pseudo-elements, leading to inconsistent visual rendering across different screen sizes.

## Bug Description

When styling pseudo-elements (e.g., `::before`, `::after`) within CSS, and particularly within media queries, there's a subtle issue where changes to parent element styles can unintentionally override the pseudo-element styles. This happens because pseudo-elements inherit properties from their parent elements. If a parent element's style changes within a media query, these changes can unexpectedly affect the styling of its pseudo-elements.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Open `bug.css`.
2. Observe the styling of the `.element` and its `::before` pseudo-element.
3. Resize your browser window to trigger the media query (min-width: 768px).
4. Note that the `::before` pseudo-element's color is unexpectedly changed due to the parent's color change.

## Solution

The solution (`bugSolution.css`) involves using more specific styling for the pseudo-element to avoid inheritance issues.  By re-declaring the properties within the media query, we ensure the intended styles are applied correctly regardless of parent element changes.
