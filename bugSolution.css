The solution involves explicitly restating styles for the pseudo-element within the media query to avoid inheritance issues.

```css
.element::before {
  content: "Text";
  color: blue;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .element {
    color: red;
  }
  .element::before {
    color: blue; /* Restated color for the pseudo-element */
  }
}
```

By explicitly restating `color: blue` for `.element::before` within the media query, we override any inherited changes from the parent element and maintain the intended styling for the pseudo-element across different screen sizes.
