The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue where a pseudo-element selector, such as `::before` or `::after`, is used incorrectly within a media query.  The issue occurs when the styles defined for the pseudo-element are inadvertently overwritten by subsequent styles applied in a different media query, or even without a media query.

```css
.element::before {
  content: "Text";
  color: blue;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .element {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `::before` pseudo-element's `color` property is set to `blue`.  However, when the viewport width exceeds 768px, the `color` property of the `.element` itself is set to `red`, which also affects the `::before` pseudo-element's color. In this case, the `::before` inherits the `color: red` rather than keeping its original `blue`. This is an unexpected and difficult-to-debug error for beginners.
